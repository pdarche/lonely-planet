			<p> Lonely Planet is an attempt at stimulating sympathy and (possibly) support for strangers using real-time Twitter data.</p>

			<p>The application listens to Twitter's streaming api for metions of the term 'lonely'.  Tweets containing links, @-mentions, and RTs are discarded, and those with geographical information are geocoded.  Tweets are then pushed out to clients and represent on the planet.</p>

			<p>Users who are logged in through Twitter can reply to tweets.  (I'd recommend trying this.  Supportive tweets are very often favorited.)</p>

			<p>Lonely Planet was orginally developed for assignment in Stewart Smith's Visualizing JS class at NYU ITP.  In late 2014 I cleaned up the code and redeployed it.</p>
